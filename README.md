# Course Project 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The following operations are to be performed.

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Steps to be Performed

1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Extract the data in your working directory. A folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" will be created.
3. Download the run_analysis.R in your working directory
4. Source("run_analysis.R") from Rstudio to generate the tidy.txt on your working folder

Please review run_analysis.R for the R packages required to run this R script.
